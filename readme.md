#We want to create a form that takes information such as name, surname, photo and phone number from the contact

#Using the main.ts file, we create a web api and take the div tag and save it in a variable. We append the app file to the div tag, and all the JavaScript code is sent to HTML through the app.

#We have a layout file which is the main part of our site and the content is placed inside it

#We have a lib folder inside which the box folder is located
Inside the box folder there is a file box, which is a function that we can use to create HTML elements.

#Inside the component folder, there are folders such as button, text field, etc., each of which is considered a part of the form we want to create.

#Inside the lib, there is a file called validate form, which we can use to validate the value of the inputs.
